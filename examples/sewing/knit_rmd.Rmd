# Simple report based on Rmd file

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(fig.path='figure/roxygen-')
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
set.seed(42) 
```

simulate x and y vector 
```{r }
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100, mean = 2, sd = 2)
```

plot the result
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
plot(x, y, col = floor(abs(x) + 1))
```
