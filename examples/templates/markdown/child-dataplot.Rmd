# Plotting the data 
Assume the data actually corresponds to measured intensities for a specific gene extracted from a larger gene expression data set. The samples were processed in two batches. We call a customized plotting function to get a first idea of what the data look like (code not shown in the report).

```{r ex2_plot1, fig.height = 4, fig.show = "asis"}
my_R_function(df = orig_df, y_lab = "log2(expression)", 
              title = "original data")
``` 


There seems to be a batch effect which we would like to remove.


<!-- include child document in which data is plotted -->
```{r get_child_batchrem, child = "child-batchrem.Rmd"}
```
